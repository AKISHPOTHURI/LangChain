The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and considered as the \"flagship event of the international cricket calendar\" by the ICC. It is widely considered the pinnacle championship of the sport of cricket.\n",
            "The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.\n",
            "The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 10 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation, compete for the title at venues within the host nation over about a month. In the 2027 edition, the format will be changed to accommodate an expanded 14-team final competition.A total of twenty teams have competed in the 13 editions of the tournament, with ten teams competing in the recent 2023 tournament. Australia has won the tournament six times, India and West Indies twice each, while Pakistan, Sri Lanka and England have won it once each. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.\n",

            "Summary: The United States is a highly developed/advanced market economy. It is the world's largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP) behind China. It has the world's seventh-highest per capita GDP (nominal) and the eighth-highest per capita GDP (PPP) as of 2022. The U.S. accounted for 25.4% of the global economy in 2022 in nominal terms, and around 15.6% in PPP terms. The U.S. dollar is the currency of record most used in international transactions and is the world's reserve currency, backed by a large U.S. treasuries market, its role as the reference standard for the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar. Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the de facto currency.The American economy is fueled by high productivity, a well developed transportation infrastructure, and extensive natural resources. Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states. In 2021, they had the highest median household income. The U.S. has one of the world's highest income inequalities among the developed countries. The largest U.S. trading partners are Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter. It has free trade agreements with several countries, including Canada and Mexico (through the USMCA), Australia, South Korea, Israel, and several others that are in effect or under negotiation.By 1890, the United States had overtaken the British Empire as the world's most productive economy. It is the world's largest producer of petroleum and natural gas. In 2016, it was the world's largest trading country as well as its third-largest manufacturer, with its manufacturing industry representing a fifth of the global manufacturing output. The U.S. not only has the largest internal market for goods, but also dominates the services trade. U.S. total trade amounted to $4.2 trillion in 2018. Of the world's 500 largest companies, 121 are headquartered in the U.S. The U.S. has the world's highest number of billionaires, with a total wealth of $3.0 trillion. US commercial banks had $22.9 trillion in assets as of December 2022. U.S. global assets under management had more than $30 trillion in assets. During the Great Recession of 2008, the U.S. economy suffered a significant decline. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act was passed by the US administration, and in the years that followed, the U.S. experienced the longest economic expansion on record by July 2019.The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume. In 2014, the U.S. economy was ranked first in international ranking on venture capital and global research and development funding. Consumer spending comprised 68% of the U.S. economy in 2022, while its labor share of income was 44% in 2021. The U.S. has the world's largest consumer market. The nation's labor market has attracted immigrants from all over the world and its net migration rate is among the highest in the world. The U.S. is one of the top-performing economies in studies such as the Ease of Doing Business Index, the Global Competitiveness Report, and others.\n",

            "Summary: The national debt of the United States is the total national debt owed by the federal government of the United States to Treasury security holders. The national debt at any point in time is the face value of the then-outstanding Treasury securities that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal agencies. The terms \"national deficit\" and \"national surplus\" usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year, not the cumulative amount of debt. In a deficit year the national debt increases as the government needs to borrow funds to finance the deficit, while in a surplus year the debt decreases as more money is received than spent, enabling the government to reduce the debt by buying back some Treasury securities. In general, government debt increases as a result of government spending and decreases from tax or other receipts, both of which fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year. There are two components of gross national debt:\n",
            "\"Debt held by the public\" – such as Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government, including those held by individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve, and foreign, state and local governments.\n",
            "\"Debt held by government accounts\" or \"intragovernmental debt\" – is non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts of programs administered by the federal government, such as the Social Security Trust Fund. Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities.Historically, the U.S. public debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) increases during wars and recessions and then subsequently declines. The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus or via growth of GDP and inflation. For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP had peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but has since reached new highs of up to 134.84% of GDP during the second quarter of 2020. In recent decades, aging demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.

(2014)\\nachieved in their work.\\n1 Introduction\\nMachine Translation (MT) is the task of translat-\\ning text without human assistance while preserv-\\ning the meaning of input text. The early approach\\nto machine translation relied heavily on hand-\\ncrafted translation rules and linguistic knowledge.\\nStarted in early around 1950s, unlike rule-based\\nmachine translation, Statistical machine transla-\\ntion (SMT) generated translations based on statis-\\ntical models whose parameters are derived from\\nthe analysis of bilingual text corpora (Koehn et al.,\\n2003). Though reliable, for SMT, it can be hard\\nto ﬁnd content for obscure languages and is less\\nsuitable for language pairs with big differences\\nin word order making the quality of translation\\nfar from satisfactory. With the progress in deep\\nlearning being applied to MT, in 2014, end-to-end\\nneural network translation model was proposed\\nby (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014)\\nwhere the term ”neural machine translation” wasformally used. Neural machine translation (NMT)\\nis the newest method of MT that uses a single\\nlarge neural network to model the entire transla-\\ntion process, freeing the need for excessive fea-\\nture engineering. Through the rapid research and\\nbreakthroughs, end-to-end neural machine trans-\\nlation has gained remarkable performances (Shi\\net al., 2021; Bahdanau et al., 2014) and have be-\\ncome mainstream approach to MT.\\n2 Related Work\\nEarly problem of NMT was often the poor trans-\\nlation for long sentences (Sutskever et al., 2014)\\nwhich can be attributed to the ﬁxed-length of\\nsource encoding in conventional encoder-decoder\\nas suggested by Cho et al. (2014a) for which the\\nconcept of attention to NMT was introduced by\\nBahdanau et al. (2014) to avoid keeping a ﬁxed\\nsource side representation.\\nAs compared to separately tuned components in\\nSMT, newly emerging Neural Machine translation\\nradically departures from previous machine learn-\\ning approaches as the training of NMT is end-to-\\nend which has signiﬁcantly improved translation\\nquality across 30 different languages (Junczys-\\nDowmunt et al., 2016). NMT model can be attrac-\\ntive for various reason one being scalability issue,\\nwhether it be memory requirements or computa-\\ntional speed. Another being able to train all the\\ncharacter embedding as each characters frequently\\noccurs in the training corpus.\\nMost neural machine translation models pro-\\nposed use encoder-decoder where a neural net-\\nwork reads and encodes a source sentence into\\na ﬁxed-length vector and a decoder then outputs\\na translation from the encoded vector, where in\\nmost of the cases the encoder and decoder are\\nmainly implemented as RNNs, CNNs or self-\\nattention network (Wu et al., 2018).

After the initial proposal by\\n(Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014),\\nmuch work has been done on the sequence-to-\\nsequence neural machine translation model rang-\\ning from new attention mechanism (Luong et al.,\\n2015) to working on the problem of out-of-\\nvocabulary words (Jean et al., 2015) for which se-\\nquential RNNs are used both for encoding source\\nsentences and generating target translation.\\nWe draw our inspiration for machine transla-\\ntion with attention from Bahdanau et al. (2014).\\nWe have chosen to base our project on this paper\\nas attention mechanism has been widely used as\\nbaseline and is thoroughly studied among the NLP\\ncommunity.\\n3 Model\\nMachine Translation is equivalent to maximizing a\\nconditional probability of a target sentence given\\nthe source sentence. In Neural Machine Trans-\\nlation, we parameterize it to maximise the condi-\\ntional probability. The approach used by Cho et al.\\n(2014b) was to encode the source sentence into\\na ﬁxed-length vector, which becomes difﬁcult to\\ncompress all the necessary information into a ﬁxed\\nlength vector, which makes it difﬁcult for the Neu-\\nral Network to handle long sentences, and thus the\\nperformance of the encoder-decoder drops as the\\nlength of the sentences increases. So we use the\\nmodel proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2014), where\\nit does not encode the input sentence into a ﬁxed-\\nlength vector, rather than it simply encodes the in-\\nput sentence into sequence of vectors, and while\\ndecoding the translation, it select subset of vectors\\nfrom the using attention mechanism. And Bah-\\ndanau et al. (2014) showed that encoder decoder\\nmodel with attention mechanism cope better with\\nlong sentences. In the next section, we will ﬁrst\\ngive a brief introduction on encoder-decoder, the\\nRNN, and one of its type, GRU, the one we used\\nin our model and ﬁnally the attention mechanism.\\n3.1 Encoder-Decoder\\nEncoder-Decoder, ﬁrst proposed by Cho et al.\\n(2014b), basically consists of 2 parts, the encoder\\nand the decoder. Encoder codes the sequence\\nof input sentence into dense vector representa-\\ntion, and then decoder takes in the encoded sen-\\ntence and decode the representation into anothersequences of words. They are trained to maximize\\nthe conditional probability of the output sentence,\\ngiven the input sentence.\\nRNN is necessary when we need to maintain the\\nword order in a sentence. This is not handled by\\nbags of words model or other statistical models. In\\naddition to input, xiand output ˆyi, we also have a\\nstate vector, ai, which is initialized with vectors of\\nzeros.iwould be the ithtimestep In the ﬁrst layer\\nof RNN, the input and state vector is fed into the\\nrecurrent unit, the recurent unit may look like1:\\nat=f(Waaat−1+Waxxi),\\nand,\\nˆyt=g(Wyaat)\\nwhere, t is the time step, Waais the weights be-\\ntween two hidden layer, Waxis the weight be-\\ntween input and hidden layer, and Wyais the\\nweight between hidden and the output layer, and\\nfcan betanh orRelu activation function, and g\\ncan besigmoid orsoftmax activation function.\\nAfter feeding the input to rnn unit, it returns a new\\nstate vector in the next time step. This new state\\nvector will be mapped to the output vector using\\nsome function. This output vector can be used as\\na prediction. The new state vector is cached and is\\npassed across the next unit of the RNN, along with\\nthe input in order for it to return the next state vec-\\ntor. This happens recursively for all the input ele-\\nments. So, when the model is reading the second\\nword, instead of just predicting output using only\\nthe second word, it also gets information from the\\nprevious time step (ﬁrst word) in terms of the state\\nvector.\\nOne of the problem of RNN is that it runs into\\nthe problem of Vaishing gradient, ﬁrst described\\nby Hochreiter (1998). This happens when we have\\na very long sentence, which tends to have long\\nterm dependencies.

The state vector in simple RNN can\\nbe considered as a memory, where the memory ac-\\ncess was not controlled. At each step, the entire\\nmemory state was read and updated. But in GRU\\nand LSTM, we use a gating mechanism to control\\nthe memory. Since, we used GRU in our model,\\nso we will only describe GRU here.\\nIn GRU, (Chung et al., 2014; Rana, 2016), the\\nactivationhj\\ntis a linear interpolation between the\\nprevious activation hj\\nt−1and the candidate ativa-\\ntion˜hj\\nt:\\nhj\\nt= (1−zj\\nt)hj\\nt−1+zj\\nt˜hj\\nt\\nwhere,zj\\ntis the update gate, that decides how\\nmuch GRU units updates its activation [See Fig.\\n1].

This is considered same as reading\\nthe ﬁrst word of the input sentence. And ﬁnally,\\nwe can compute the reset gate by :\\nrj\\nt=σ(Wrxt+Urht−1)j.\\nOne of the weakness of RNN is that it only uses\\ninformation that is earlier in the sequence to make\\npredictions but not the information which are later\\nin the sequence. When predicting the output at\\ntime step i, it does not use the word at time step i+1\\nor i+2 or any other words in the later time step. So,\\nit would be useful to know not just the information\\nfrom the words from the previous time step but\\nalso the information from the later time steps.\\nSo, we use Bidirectional RNN, ﬁrst proposed\\nby (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997).

The\\nencoder takes in the input sentence and converts\\nthem into a vector representation\\nThe encoder can be an RNN (Cho et al., 2014b)\\nor LSTM unit (Sutskever et al., 2014). They pro-\\ncesses the input sentence, pass it through RNN or\\nLSTM, and when it encounters the end of sen-\\ntence, then the hidden state, that captured all the\\nrelevant information passes it to the decoder. Then\\nthis information is used to predict the translations\\nin the decoder, which can be RNN or LSTM, until\\nit predicts the end of the sentence token. The hid-\\nden state needs to remember every word from the\\ninput sentence. So that is why this model tends to\\nwork for short sentences and not long sentences.\\nEven though if we used LSTM or GRU, which\\ntends to remember the words that occured very\\nearly in the sequence, it will still not be able to\\nlearn the alignment between the source word and\\nthe target word. They often forget the initial part\\nof the sentence once they are processed in the en-\\ncoder. That is why we use an alignment mecha-\\nnism called attention. They help to memorize this\\ninformation for longer sentences. But we need to\\nlearn this alignment. It can vary from language to\\nlanguage.3.2 Attention\\nIn this section, we will speciﬁcally deﬁne the\\nalignment mechanism, [See Figure 2] that we used\\nin our model. In RNN Encoder-Decoder model\\n(Sutskever et al., 2014), we faced with the bottle-\\nneck problem, where the complete sequence of in-\\nformation of the source sentence, must be captured\\nby one single vector, i.e. the last hidden unit of the\\nencoder RNN is used as a context vector for the\\ndecoder, which becomes difﬁcult for the decoder\\nto summarise large input sequence at once. This\\nalso poses a problem where the encoder is not able\\nto memorize the words coming at the beginning\\nof the sentences, which leads to poor translation\\nof the source sentence. The Attention mechanism\\njust addresses this issue, by retaining and utilising\\nall the hidden state of the input sentence during the\\ndecoding phase.\\nDuring the decoding phase, the model creates\\nan alignment between each time step of the de-\\ncoder output and all of the encoder hidden state.\\nWe need to learn this alignment. Each output of\\nthe decoder can selectively pick out speciﬁc ele-\\nments from the sequence to produce the output.\\nSo, this allows the model to focus and pay more\\n”Attention” to the relevant part of the input se-\\nquence.\\nThe ﬁrst attention model was proposed by Bah-\\ndanau et al.

It tries to preserve\\nthe meaning of the whole sentence, and it does not\\nblindly takes the word from the reference, it tries\\nto generalize.\\nRefer to Table 4 at the end of the paper for\\nmore translations from Spanish to English using\\nEncoder Decoder model with Attention Mecha-\\nnism.\\n7 Discussion\\nAfter trying to achieve the result similar to what\\nwas presented in the paper, we are satisﬁed with\\nour result though there is much that can be im-\\nproved. Limitation caused by the hardware held\\nus back from achieving better results. We used the\\nserver provided by the university and as a backup\\nused google colab for our work, so we had to be\\nwary of the maintenance schedule happening in\\nthe server and the limitation of 24 hrs of work-\\ntime on google colab, which otherwise could in-\\nterrupt while we were training our model. So,\\nto overcome these challenges we decided to use\\n1M sentences from each form Spanish and English\\ndataset, and reduce the parameters for encoder-\\ndecoder.\\nWe also faced problem with length of the vo-\\ncabulary size of English and Spanish sentences,\\nwhere the vocabulary size of the English sen-\\ntence were the output dimension, and vocabularysize of Spanish sentence were input dimensions of\\nour model. This leads to increase in number of\\ntrainable parameters, the decoding complexity in-\\ncreases with number of target words (vocabulary\\nsize of the English), where this problem has been\\naddressed by Jean et al. (2015).\\n8 Conclusion\\nThe approach proposed by Cho et al. (2014b) was\\nto encode the whole sentence into ﬁxed length vec-\\ntor, and this becomes problematic when dealing\\nwith long sentences. We extend this basic encoder-\\ndecoder model by an Attention mechanism (Bah-\\ndanau et al., 2014), where the model searches for\\nthe input word computed from the encoder, which\\nbest align with the target word, when generat-\\ning each target word. This frees the model from\\nhaving to encode the source sentence into a ﬁxed\\nlength vector, only rely on the information rele-\\nvant for generating each target word. We com-\\npared our model for Spanish to English translation\\nwith both of these approaches, and found that our\\nmodel works better than the encoder-decoder ap-\\nproach (Cho et al., 2014b), and have slightly lower\\nresults than the architecture with Attention mech-\\nanism, (Bahdanau et al., 2014). We also observed\\nthat the model tries to align the target word with\\nthe relevant word from the translated sentence.\\nIn the future work, there are several things we\\ncan try. We can train our model on much larger\\ndataset, with a better hardware and with differ-\\nent attention models. We can also focus on how\\nto handle the stop words, punctuation, as we can\\nsee on Table 2 and Table 3, which accounts for\\nthe highest word count, and also to handle the un-\\nknown words, which does not appear in the train-\\ning data, but in the test data.\\nReferences\\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua\\nBengio.
